# New Year, New Portfolio ðŸ¥³

## Purpose

To update my outdated portfolio into something I could be proud of and start adding to again.

Problems from the initial page included:

- Poor usability in the form of bad color contrast choices, links without calculated text content,
- Outdated skills section
- A questionable synthwave-esque design that wasn't quite working
- Difficult update process

In my redesign, the marks I wanted to hit were:

- [x] Use a Gatsby on Netlify deploy process
- [x] Ace the Google Lighthouse accessibility test
- [x] Prioritize readability and responsivity

## How to Use

To start the development server, run:

```
gatsby develop
```

To get the site ready for deployment, run:

```
gatsby build
```
